<hr />
<p>I am the mom of a little cute girl named Ilinca.</p>
<p>I graduated Pharmacy College in 2012 and worked as a pharmacist until now.</p>    
<p>In highschool I studied maths and informatics, 
    but at that moment I was more attracted to chemistry and biology.
    Lately I started to want more and more to learn how to make web development.</p>
<p>In my free time I love to crochet amigurumis, drink coffee and listen to music.
Often I enjoy taking pictures.</p>
